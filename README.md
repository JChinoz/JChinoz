### Heya, I'm Jake ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Developer who is currently exploring Full-Stack and Mobile app development through self learning in Udemy.

I've been primarily involved in programming backend systems during the early days of my career. However, I find building front-end user interfaces much more relatable and rewarding as it is often the first point of contact for end-users. As an occasional frustrated end-user myself, I tend to focus primarily on improving UX for projects I'm involved in to provide a smooth and hassle-free experience.
