### Heya, I'm Jake ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Experienced Software Engineer with 8 years of experience in the professional field with the majority of my time dealing with web technology.

I've been primarily involved in programming backend systems during the early days of my career. However, I find building front-end user interfaces much more relatable and rewarding as it is often the first point of contact for end-users.
As an occasional frustrated end-user myself, I do my best to understand the pain and entry points of the end user and have been involved heavily in both the development of end-to-end full-scale applications from scratch as well as optimizing SEO in the products that I have been involved in.
